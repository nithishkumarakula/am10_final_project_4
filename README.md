# AM10 Data Visualization - Proposal for Group Project 

### Our idea – Brazil

Our idea is to shed light on a country that is in the centre of discussions around the world – Brazil. 

Brazil has a monumental importance for the global climate, it is the fourth largest democracy in the world, it has lots of natural resources and it is situated conveniently in the centre of South America. This is why Brazil is one of the five major emerging economies known as the BRICS countries.  

However, Brazil faces huge issues such as high corruption, dissatisfaction with democratic institutions and an increasing rate of deforestation in the Amazon rain forest. Our project intends to show the country’s importance to climate change and how political dynamics affect the country’s efforts against climate change.

### Our structure 

This project is structured in four parts:

###### **1. Brazil’s importance for the global climate**

* We want to highlight and further improve our audience’s understanding of Brazil’s importance for the global climate.

###### **2: Brazil’s election in 2018 and the ensuing policies Jair Bolsonaro established** 

* We intend to show Bolsonaro’s support on a map using a geospatial analysis.

###### **3: Impact of Bolsonaro’s policies on Brazil’s efforts against climate change**

* Analysis of deforestation in the Amazon rain forest over time.

###### **4: Brazil’s 2022 Presidential elections and a potential turnaround**

* We intend to show Lula’s support on a map using a geospatial analysis.

In addition, we might be able to find data on Lula’s plans for climate protection and forecasts 

### Our use of data 

Our objective is to shed light on Brazil from multiple directions: From an environmental a political perspective. Therefore, one data set won’t be sufficient to answer this question. Therefore, we aim to use several data sets.

We attempt to find one comprehensive and complex data set about Brazil’s importance for global climate change. Furthermore, we try to find one data set per election, one for 2018 and one for 2022.

To show Bolsonaro’s influence on Brazil’s efforts against climate change, we try to find one dataset showing deforestation over time.
